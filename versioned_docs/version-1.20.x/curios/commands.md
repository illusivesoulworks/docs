  * `curios replace charm 0 Player123 with minecraft:totem_of_undying 1`

## Entity Selector Options
---
Curios has a custom entity selector option to use with commands that target entities, such as @a or @p.

The option starts with curios= and takes in a single **CompoundTag** as an argument. A blank tag would be `curios={}`.

### Tag Format
The **CompoundTag** has the following fields:

* `item`
  * **required:** false
  * **type:** **CompoundTag**
  * **description:** Denotes an item to match in the target's curios inventory.
  * **Example:** 
    * `curios={item:{id:"minecraft:glass_bottle"}}` 
    * This will search for a `minecraft:glass_bottle` in the target's curios inventory.

* `slot`
  * **required:** false
  * **type:** string[]
  * **description:** Denotes a slot type to search in the target's curios inventory.
  * **Example:**
    * `curios={slot:["ring"]}`
    * This will search for `"ring"` slots in the target's curios inventory.

* `index`
  * **required:** false
  * **type:** int[min, max]
  * **description:** Denotes the indices in slots to search in the target's curios inventory.
  * **Example:**
    * `curios={index:[0,1]}`
    * This will search for the first index of each slot type in the target's curios inventory.

* `exclusive`
  * **required:** false
  * **type:** boolean
  * **description:** Denotes whether the selector is searching for only one match.
  * **Example:**
    * `curios={slot:["ring"],exclusive:true}`
    * This will search for `"ring"` slots in the target's curios inventory but will not return a match if any other slot type is found in the inventory as well.

### Inverting

The selector option also supports inverting. Placing a `!` before the **CompoundTag** will invert the search.
For example, `curios=!{slot:["ring"]}` will search for targets that do *not* have `"ring"` slots in their curios inventory.

### Examples

* To kill all players who have a `minecraft:glass_bottle` in a `"ring"` slot of the curios inventory:
    * `/kill @a[curios={item:{id:"minecraft:glass_bottle"},slot:["ring"]}]`
