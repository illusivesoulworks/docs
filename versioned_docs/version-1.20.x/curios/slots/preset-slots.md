# Preset Slot Types

A list of commonly used slot types that are already defined in Curios for developers to use.

## Overview
---
One of the benefits of using Curios is that multiple developers can share slot types between each other, allowing
mechanics and items to cooperate seamlessly. As long as the `identifier` for the slot type is the same, the slot types
will be merged together upon registration. To reduce the need for redundant code and data, Curios provides a preset
list of slot types that are commonly used in the modded community and should be favored over creating wholly unique slot
types when applicable.

:::note
Although these slot types are provided by Curios, they are not added to any entities by default. This needs to be done
by the developer or user by [adding slot types to entities](entity-register.mdx).
